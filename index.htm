<p>I think this book, like every book, has morals. We can learn and absorb a lot from this book. We can reflect Peeta’s kindness or impersonate Katniss’s loyalty.
<br>
This book has many things you can take with you out of the book that’s what makes it a good book. If i was to give this book a rating it would be 8/10.
<br>
The main reason I would give this an 8/10 would be because of the morals, exciting storyline, the uniqueness of it, and so much more.
<br>
It actually deserves the 8. The reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because I would consider the diary of a wimpy kid a proper 10/10,
<br>
probably because I grew up with it but I just don't think the hunger games is that good. I had heard about this book but the name and cover and the idea of it being a book made me unattracted to the text.
<br>
This book really takes the quote of “don’t judge a book by its cover”.
